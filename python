""" Bob, a data analyst, requires a program to automate the process of analyzing character frequency in a given text. This program should allow the user to input a string, calculate the frequency of each character within the text, save these character frequencies to a file named "char_frequency.txt," and display the results.

Input format :
The input consists of the string.

Output format :
The first line prints "Character Frequencies:".

The following lines print the character frequency in the format: "X: Y" where X is the character and Y is the count.

"""
